; Tempest machine may cause hardware damage, personal injury, or death.
; If I have seen further, it's becasue I stood on the shoulders of giants

; Orientation:   Vertical
; Type:          Color Vector
; CRT:           Color, 19-inc Wells Gardner 19K6100 (most machines)
; CPU:           6502A @ 1.5MHz
; ROM:           24K
; RAM:           6K

; As of 1-22-2017 this code assembles with the HXA assembler from:
;   http://home.earthlink.net/~hxa/
; As of 6-20-020 that project is now located on github and works ok:
;   https://github.com/AntonTreuenfels/HXA_Cross_Assembler
;
; It will produce the original factory ROM image as a single OBJ that can be
; split into 2K sections to burn onto EPROMs. Any reduction in code
; size is automatically padded to fill the full 20K so the 6502 vectors wind
; up in the right place (but only because the p1 ROM is mirrored up at FFFx).
; Please ensure you have the legal rights to do so before making any ROM chips.

; The following is the "program" that is executed in PCode.  In order to make it readable, I've added a
; macro that yields the relative address of a label (relative to the beginning of the PCode Program) less
; one, which is how the table was coded by Atari.  I've opeted NOT to do the entire PCode program because
; I do not want to introduce a huge dependency on a macro, and the first few blocks can be returned to
; "normal" fairly easily.  The rest I left in binary as an exercise for the reader :-)

; Points vector.
; Each point occupies two.bytes.  The second is just a draw/nodraw flag,
; always 0 (nodraw) or 1 (draw).  The first holds the coordinates.  They
; are encoded thus:
; xx yyy xxx
; || ||| +++---> X coordinate
; || +++-------> Y coordinate
; |+-----------> 1 if X coord should be negated, 0 if not
; +------------> 1 if Y coord should be negated, 0 if not
; For example, the two.bytes at $bfd6 are $4a $01.  The $01 indicates that
; a line should be drawn; the $4a is 01 001 010, so we have X=-2 Y=1.
; flipper
; Why flippers use eight lines rather than six I don't know.  Maybe someone
; felt the crossing point in the middle should (FSVO "should") be on a
; point with integral coordinates.  Maybe it's a historical artifact from
; some previous flipper design (the format here means you can't have a
; delta of 8 or higher for a line, so if the upper points were pulled out
; to the ends, you couldn't do a six-line flipper).
